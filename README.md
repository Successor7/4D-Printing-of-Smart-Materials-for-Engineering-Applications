The project 4D Printing of Smart Materials for Engineering Applications focuses on designing and optimizing adaptive structures capable of shape transformation over time. Using Polylactic Acid (PLA) as the base material, the study emphasizes geometry-driven strategiesvarying infill density, wall thickness, and internal patterns like chevron and herringboneto overcome PLAs rigidity without chemical modification.

Key objectives include developing cross-shaped gripper prototypes, studying thermal activation around PLAs glass transition temperature, and analyzing how geometry influences stress distribution and deformation. Results show that optimized designs with thinner walls and lower infill achieve bending angles up to 65, demonstrating reliable, repeatable shape-memory behavior.

By integrating principles of materials science, additive manufacturing, and mechanical design, the project establishes a sustainable pathway for cost-effective actuators, biomedical devices, and soft robotic applications, positioning PLA-based 4D printing as a cornerstone of next-generation smart manufacturing.
